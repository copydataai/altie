# 🌈  Alacritty-themes built with Go 🐻 
**If do you have a better suggestion about altie, please let me know in issues**

The purpose about this project is an alternative to [alacritty-themes](https://github.com/rajasegar/alacritty-themes) based in use Go.

I just want a better experience to change in different themes more interactive or informative as a TUI(Terminal User Interface).
