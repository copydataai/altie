# 🌈  Alacritty-themes built with Go 🐻 
**If you have a better suggestion about Altie, please let me know in issues**

The purpose of this project is an alternative to [alacritty-themes](https://github.com/rajasegar/alacritty-themes) based in use Go.

I just want a better experience to change in different themes more interactive or informative as a TUI(Terminal User Interface).


## Installation
**Please follow the below instructions**
Before to compile **Please** run inside the repository to install the themes
``` sh
git clone https://github.com/copydataai/altie.git

cd altie

go run cmd/altie/main.go
```

After you run it for the first time, you can compile and move the binary to `usr/bin/altie`

``` sh
go build cmd/altie/main.go
sudo mv altie /usr/bin/altie
```

Although you can use go install **Hahaha**😝
